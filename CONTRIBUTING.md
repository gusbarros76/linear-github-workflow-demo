# Contributing (Linear ↔ GitHub workflow)

## Branch naming

Create branches using:

`linear/<ISSUE-ID>-<short-description>`

Example:

`linear/ABC-123-crud-alunos`

## Pull Requests

To allow the Linear ↔ GitHub integration to automatically link the PR to the issue, include the **Linear Issue ID** (e.g. `ABC-123`) in:

- the PR title (preferred), or
- the PR description

## Why this matters

With a standard Linear ↔ GitHub integration enabled, referencing the Issue ID allows Linear to:

- link the PR to the issue
- update issue status automatically when the PR is merged (depending on your Linear workflow settings)
